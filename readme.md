#### Introduction

Color Assistant is a tiny software that flashes the clicked color appeared anywhere on the screen, thus making it easier to read color-labeled data graphs for people with color vision deficiency (color blind). It might even be helpful to normal vision people for reading figures with too complicated colors. Windows only.  

Color Assistant is in open beta, and any suggestions about how it could better help people is welcome!
